          An about us page helps a business distinguish itself from the competition. This individualization is valuable for businesses
          that are using drop shipping or are otherwise selling products offered by other stores. Customers place a great deal of value
          on price, delivery options and customer service, but will also remember a store that has a more developed personality.
          The about us page helps online retailers develop a relationship with customers and build trust by putting a face and a
          story to the name on the storefront.</p>
